In working through the SQL problem statements provided in the Experiment and Solution Sets materials, I applied my database management and query optimization skills to design accurate and efficient solutions for a variety of data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis tasks. Each numbered .md file contained the SQL solution to its corresponding .pdf problem, serving both as a learning resource and a reference for best practices in query writing.

My approach began with carefully analyzing each problem statement to fully understand the data requirements and constraints. I applied SQL fundamentals such as SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to retrieve and organize data effectively. For more complex problems, I utilized JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables, ensuring correct relationships through appropriate primary and foreign key usage.

I also incorporated aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN() to derive meaningful insights from datasets. Subqueries and nested SELECT statements were used to break down problems into manageable parts, improving both readability and logic flow. Where applicable, I applied set operations such as UNION and INTERSECT to address multi-condition queries.
